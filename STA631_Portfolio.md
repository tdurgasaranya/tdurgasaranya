# Statistics Portfolio

## Regression Concepts
In this chapter, I have learned about the fundamental concepts of regression analysis. Regression is a statistical method used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. It helps us understand how changes in the independent variables influence the dependent variable.

## Chapter 1A: Simple Linear Regression
In this section, I explored the concept of simple linear regression, which involves a single independent variable and a single dependent variable. I learned how to fit a straight line to the data using the method of least squares. The key parameters in simple linear regression are the slope and the intercept of the regression line, which help us make predictions and understand the relationship between the variables.

## Chapter 1B: Multiple Linear Regression
This chapter delved into multiple linear regression, where we extend the concept of simple linear regression to include multiple independent variables. I learned how to fit a multiple regression model, interpret the coefficients, and perform hypothesis tests to assess the significance of the variables. Multiple linear regression allows us to capture more complex relationships between variables and make more accurate predictions when multiple factors influence the dependent variable.

Throughout these chapters, I gained practical knowledge on applying regression analysis using statistical software, interpreting the results, and effectively communicating the findings. I am now equipped to use regression techniques to analyze real-world data and draw meaningful insights from it. My statistics portfolio reflects my proficiency in regression concepts and applications, showcasing my ability to handle data analysis tasks and draw valuable conclusions.








- I've consistently engaged and demonstrated my ability to apply the knowledge and concepts learnt from the class and the textbook.
- I have been actively engaging in the Teams, online class discussions and trying to contribute to class activities (Breakout rooms), solidifying my understanding and enhancing my learning experience.
