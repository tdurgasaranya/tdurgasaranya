**This report provides an overview of my proficiency and understanding of the chapters covered in our STA631 course**

## Regression Concepts
In this chapter, I have learned about the fundamental concepts of regression analysis. Regression is a statistical method used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. It helps us understand how changes in the independent variables influence the dependent variable.

## Simple Linear Regression
In this section, I explored the concept of simple linear regression, which involves a single independent variable and a single dependent variable. I learned how to fit a straight line to the data using the method of least squares. The key parameters in simple linear regression are the slope and the intercept of the regression line, which help us make predictions and understand the relationship between the variables.

## Multiple Linear Regression
This chapter delved into multiple linear regression, where we extend the concept of simple linear regression to include multiple independent variables. I learned how to fit a multiple regression model, interpret the coefficients, and perform hypothesis tests to assess the significance of the variables. Multiple linear regression allows us to capture more complex relationships between variables and make more accurate predictions when multiple factors influence the dependent variable.

Throughout these chapters, I gained practical knowledge on applying regression analysis using statistical software, interpreting the results, and effectively communicating the findings. I am now equipped to use regression techniques to analyze real-world data and draw meaningful insights from it. My statistics portfolio reflects my proficiency in regression concepts and applications, showcasing my ability to handle data analysis tasks and draw valuable conclusions.

# Logistic Regression

## Introduction to Logistic Regression
Logistic regression is a powerful statistical method used for binary classification tasks, where the outcome variable is categorical with two classes. I learned how logistic regression models the probability of an event occurring based on one or more predictor variables. The logistic function (sigmoid) maps the linear combination of predictors to a range between 0 and 1, enabling us to interpret the output as probabilities.

## Multinomial Regression
In this section, I explored the extension of logistic regression to handle multi-class classification problems. Multinomial regression is used when the outcome variable has more than two categories. I learned how to set up and interpret multinomial logistic regression models, which help us understand the relationships between the predictors and multiple response categories.

## Generalized Linear Models (GLMs)
Generalized Linear Models (GLMs) provide a flexible framework that includes both linear regression and logistic regression as special cases. I learned about the theoretical foundation of GLMs and how they handle different types of response variables (e.g., continuous, binary, count data). GLMs allow us to use various link functions and probability distributions to model the relationship between predictors and the response, making them adaptable to a wide range of data types.

Throughout these chapters, I gained a deep understanding of logistic regression, multinomial regression, and generalized linear models. I can now apply these techniques to solve classification problems, make predictions, and analyze categorical data effectively. My statistics portfolio demonstrates my proficiency in these advanced regression methods and showcases my ability to handle diverse data analysis tasks using statistical models.



- I've consistently engaged and demonstrated my ability to apply the knowledge and concepts learnt from the class and the textbook.
- I have been actively engaging in the Teams, online class discussions and trying to contribute to class activities (Breakout rooms), solidifying my understanding and enhancing my learning experience.
